Armed with a trusty towel (or rather, a diverse skill set in <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PHP</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, and more), Alphons feasts on creativity and dedicates himself to every new challenge that arises in these exciting fields. Just as <strong><em>The Guide</em></strong> itself is an indispensable resource, Alphons strives to expand his knowledge and capabilities to become a go-to expert. His experiences range from developing AI tools and enhancing digital experience platforms (DXP) with AI at <a href="https://www.qed42.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">QED42</a>, to creating a witty Slack bot named <em>Marvin</em> (though hopefully a bit less depressed than the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paranoid Android</a>).</p> <p>Alphons’ ultimate goal is nothing short of <strong><em>revolutionary</em></strong>: to recreate the “<em>consciousness transfer</em>” depicted in the movie “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chappie</a>.” He envisions a future where humanity has evolved beyond the confines of flesh and bone, into a network of interconnected consciousnesses. Whether the task at hand is building <em>AI-assisted search</em>, giving “eyes” to language models, or laying the groundwork for this <strong>transformative technology</strong>, Alphons approaches it all with the unbridled curiosity of a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Babel_Fish" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Babel fish</a> and the determination of a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Magrathea" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Magrathean</a> sculptor.

His passion for technology in general, and his ability to learn anything new in that space in a remarkably small period of time always amazed me! You ask Alphons if he knows something, it’s rare that he doesn’t. And if he doesn’t, it’s not for long! The amazing things he did at QED42 was nothing short of genius! He once did a POC that integrated AI search to a Drupal website; And for a programmer with just under 3 years of experience, he came out of that with a product that looked like it was built by a team of highly experienced Senior Developers. It was just a pleasure listening to him speak about it. Alphons proves every day that experience is not calculated in years, but in the volume and variety of things you accomplish in those years. I can honestly say a year of work experience for Alphons should be considered as at least two! <br><br> And you can’t simply ask Alphons something about technology. :) Be prepared to learn almost everything about what you just asked him. He will write you an essay that will paint a very detailed and elaborate picture of what you just asked him. This also extends to the reports (performance analysis, incident analysis, bug reports etc) he creates as well. Any company would be lucky to have him. I wish him all the best.” - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhaisasidharan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Abhai Sasidharan</a></strong> <em>(Abhai managed Alphons directly)</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Alphons is one of the most curious person i have ever came across, Always up for exploring new and upcoming technologies, truly a technical geek and in love with linux systems and the machines. Alphons is definitely an asset for any organisation.” - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemant-gupta-b854839b/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hemant Gupta</a></strong> <em>(Hemant was Alphons’ mentor)</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“It has been a pleasure to know Alphons through community events. His eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge are truly admirable. I have always been impressed by his unique tech vision. <br><br> In addition to being a skilled Drupal developer, Alphons is my go-to person for any AI-related tech queries. His expertise is invaluable. <br> Any organization would be fortunate to have Alphons as part of their team. I wholeheartedly recommend him for his exceptional talents and contributions.” - <strong><a href="hhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisekmazumdar/">Abhisek Mazumdar</a></strong>, <em>(Abhisek was senior to Alphons but didn’t manage Alphons directly)</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Alphons Jaimon’s journey, from our college days to his current role as an AI Engineer at QED42, is truly inspiring. His exceptional technical skills, natural leadership, and unwavering support for his colleagues make him stand out as a beacon of excellence. <br><br> What truly sets Alphons apart is his genuine care for his peers and his dedication to fostering collaboration and mentorship. Whether leading projects or offering assistance, his integrity and empathy shine through in every interaction. His involvement in community initiatives like Developer Circles from Facebook underscores his commitment to nurturing talent and fostering growth. <br><br> In Alphons Jaimon, you’ll find not just a highly skilled AI Engineer, but also a compassionate leader and a trusted friend. His journey embodies the power of passion, perseverance, and unwavering dedication to excellence. I have full confidence that Alphons will continue to make significant contributions to the field of technology and inspire all those fortunate enough to cross paths with him. Collaborating with Alphons has been an honor, and I eagerly anticipate the remarkable achievements that lie ahead in his journey.” - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujvijjan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anuj Vijjan</a></strong> <em>(Anuj and Alphons studied together)</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“I highly recommend Alphons as an exceptional AI engineer for his pivotal role in our recent AI search project. His adeptness in grasping complex AI concepts and coding proficiency significantly enhanced project outcomes. Alphons consistently showcased outstanding problem-solving skills and a collaborative spirit, overcoming challenges with ingenuity. His proactive approach, coupled with excellent communication, made him an invaluable asset to our team. Alphons’s dedication and technical prowess make him a top choice for any AI-related endeavor.” - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-ghetiya/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nishant Ghetiya</a></strong> <em>(Nishant worked with Alphons on the same team)</em></p> </blockquote> </div> <h2> <a href="/ajv009-v2/blog/" style="color: inherit">latest posts</a> </h2> <div class="news"> <div class="table-responsive" style="max-height: 60vw"> <table class="table table-sm table-borderless"> <tr> <th scope="row" style="width: 20%">Jan 27, 2024</th> <td> <a class="news-title" href="/ajv009-v2/blog/2024/code-diff/">a post with code diff</a> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="width: 20%">Jan 27, 2024</th> <td> <a class="news-title" href="/ajv009-v2/blog/2024/advanced-images/">a post with advanced image components</a> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="width: 20%">Jan 27, 2024</th> <td> <a class="news-title" href="/ajv009-v2/blog/2024/vega-lite/">a post with vega lite</a> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6D%61%69%6C@%61%6A%76%30%30%39.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://wa.me/+91%208237842347" title="whatsapp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-whatsapp"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/ajv009" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alphons-jaimon" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alphons009" title="X" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/xeonaj" title="Kaggle" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-kaggle"></i></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/alphons.jaimon" title="Instagram" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a> <a href="https://discord.com/users/ajv009" title="Discord" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i></a> <a href="/ajv009-v2/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note">I usually prefer to be contacted via email.
