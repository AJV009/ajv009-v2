**Alphons Jaimon** is an aspiring *AI Engineer* who, much like the intrepid [Arthur Dent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Dent), is on an adventurous journey - though his quest is to explore the vast reaches of **artificial intelligence** and other *futuristic technologies* rather than the galaxy. Armed with a trusty towel (or rather, a diverse skill set in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and more), Alphons feasts on creativity and dedicates himself to every new challenge that arises in these exciting fields. Just as ***The Guide*** itself is an indispensable resource, Alphons strives to expand his knowledge and capabilities to become a go-to expert. His experiences range from developing AI tools and enhancing digital experience platforms (DXP) with AI at [QED42](https://www.qed42.com/), to creating a witty Slack bot named *Marvin* (though hopefully a bit less depressed than the original [Paranoid Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android)).

Alphons' ultimate goal is nothing short of ***revolutionary***: to recreate the "*consciousness transfer*" depicted in the movie "[Chappie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/)." He envisions a future where humanity has evolved beyond the confines of flesh and bone, into a network of interconnected consciousnesses. Whether the task at hand is building *AI-assisted search*, giving "eyes" to language models, or laying the groundwork for this **transformative technology**, Alphons approaches it all with the unbridled curiosity of a [Babel fish](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Babel_Fish) and the determination of a [Magrathean](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Magrathea) sculptor. For organizations embarking on their own journey into the uncharted territory of *GenerativeAI* and similar technologies, Alphons is the friendly face in the crowd, the [Ford Prefect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Prefect_(character)) to their *Arthur Dent*, ready to help them navigate this new landscape and harness AI's potential for innovation.

**In short**: Alphons Jaimon knows where his towel is, and he's ready to help solve all your AI problems. But more than that, he's on a mission to guide humanity towards its next great evolutionary leap. Because as any [hoopy frood](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frood) knows, AI just might be the answer to the [ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)). So grab your *babel fish* and join him on this exciting journey towards a future beyond imagination!

## What people say about me
(Copied from [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alphons-jaimon/) recommendations)

> "Alphons is a uniquely exceptional software engineer. His passion for technology in general, and his ability to learn anything new in that space in a remarkably small period of time always amazed me! You ask Alphons if he knows something, it's rare that he doesn't. And if he doesn't, it's not for long! The amazing things he did at QED42 was nothing short of genius! He once did a POC that integrated AI search to a Drupal website; And for a programmer with just under 3 years of experience, he came out of that with a product that looked like it was built by a team of highly experienced Senior Developers. It was just a pleasure listening to him speak about it. Alphons proves every day that experience is not calculated in years, but in the volume and variety of things you accomplish in those years. I can honestly say a year of work experience for Alphons should be considered as at least two! <br><br>
And you can't simply ask Alphons something about technology. :) Be prepared to learn almost everything about what you just asked him. He will write you an essay that will paint a very detailed and elaborate picture of what you just asked him. This also extends to the reports (performance analysis, incident analysis, bug reports etc) he creates as well. Any company would be lucky to have him. I wish him all the best." - **[Abhai Sasidharan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhaisasidharan/)** _(Abhai managed Alphons directly)_
